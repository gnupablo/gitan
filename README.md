# Githan - Github Analyzer

Githan ("Github Analyzer") is an open source tool to explore and audit the security of the Github repositories. The goal of this project
is to scan and detect probable vulnerabilities, libraries version, services, information leak (passwords, usernames etc.), access points,
and many other components. 

The biggest difference regarding other services is that githan is mainly backed on web harvesting and text mining methods, and should be 
used as a recognition and gathering information solution, not as a complete or a powerful detection tool such as Nessus, openvas, nmap to 
name but a few.
